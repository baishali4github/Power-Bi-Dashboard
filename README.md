## Key Insights from the Analysis
Based on the analysis conducted through the BI dashboard, several key insights regarding employee attrition were identified. By examining the attrition rates across various age groups, it was found that employees aged 26 to 35 years experienced a notably higher attrition rate. This trend was visualized using age-specific attrition data.

Furthermore, the educational background analysis revealed that employees with a life science education were more likely to leave the company.

Salary analysis showed that attrition was more prevalent among employees earning up to 5k. This insight was derived from breaking down attrition rates by different salary slabs, highlighting a significant trend among lower-income employees.

Job role analysis identified that the top four roles with the highest attrition rates were Lab Technician, Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Sales Representative. 

Lastly, the tenure analysis indicated that employees most commonly left the company after working for one year. This pattern was observed by analyzing the attrition rates in relation to the number of years employees had been with the company.

These insights collectively provide a detailed understanding of the factors contributing to employee attrition, enabling the company to make informed decisions to improve employee retention.
